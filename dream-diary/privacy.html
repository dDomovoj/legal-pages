  <p>dDreams is a sleep tracker application designed to help users log, analyze and visualize their sleep and dream-related data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and the choices you have.</p>

  <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <!-- <li><strong>Account & contact information:</strong> email address and any profile information you voluntarily provide.</li> -->
    <li><strong>Sleep & dream data:</strong> sleep times, durations, sleep quality ratings, dream descriptions, mood, tags, and any notes you enter into the app (\"Sleep Data\").</li>
    <!-- <li><strong>Device & usage data:</strong> device model, OS version, app usage events, crash reports, and analytics telemetry.</li> -->
    <!-- <li><strong>Optional sensor data:</strong> if you enable integrations (e.g., Apple Health), we may read sleep or activity data you authorize via the relevant platform API.</li> -->
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide, operate and maintain the app features (including sleep analytics and personalized feedback).</li>
    <li>To improve and develop new features, and analyze app usage.</li>
    <li>To communicate with you about account matters, updates, or support requests.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations and protect the rights and safety of the service and users.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Legal bases for processing (if you are in the EEA/UK)</h2>
  <p>Where applicable, we rely on the following legal bases: your consent; performance of a contract; our legitimate interests (improving the app, fraud prevention) and compliance with legal obligations.</p>

  <h2>4. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may disclose information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> analytics, crash reporting, cloud hosting — only to the extent needed to perform services for us.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal reasons:</strong> when required by law, legal process, or to protect rights, safety, or property.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in case of merger, acquisition, or sale of assets (we will notify users where required).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your account information and Sleep Data for as long as your account exists and as needed to provide the service. Aggregated and anonymized data may be kept longer for analytics purposes.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable administrative and technical safeguards designed to protect data. However, no system is 100% secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>7. Third-party services and integrations</h2>
  <p>When you enable third-party integrations (e.g., Apple Health), data access is subject to the third party's permissions and policies. We only request data necessary for the feature and honor your platform-level permissions.</p>

  <h2>8. Analytics and cookies</h2>
  <p>We may use analytics providers to understand usage patterns. These tools may use cookies or similar technologies when you view our web pages. Analytics data is used in aggregated or pseudonymized form.</p>

  <h2>9. Your rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access to personal data we hold about you.</li>
    <li>Correction of inaccurate data.</li>
    <li>Request deletion of your account and personal data.</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.</li>
    <li>Object to or restrict certain processing, and data portability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:dream.diary.help@gmail.com">dream.diary.help@gmail.com</a>. We may ask for information to verify your identity.</p>

  <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
  <p>Data may be processed or stored in countries different from your residence. We apply safeguards required by law to protect data transferred across borders.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the new policy with an updated effective date. If changes are material, we will provide a more prominent notice.</p>
