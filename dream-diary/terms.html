    <p>Welcome to <strong>dDreams</strong>. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the
      mobile application and related services (collectively, the "Service") operated by
      <strong>Dzmitry Duleba</strong> ("we", "us"). By downloading, installing, or using the Service, you agree to
      these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>You may use the Service for personal, non-commercial purposes. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and
      not to misuse the Service (including providing false or misleading information).</p>

    <h2>2. Account and registration</h2>
    <p>Certain features may require creating an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
      account credentials and for all activity under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.</p>

    <h2>3. User content and Sleep Data</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of the content you submit (e.g., dream descriptions, notes). By submitting content, you
      grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, and display the
      content as necessary to provide and improve the Service (for example, to generate analytics or visualizations). We
      will treat Sleep Data as described in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. Prohibited conduct</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Interfering with or disrupting the Service.</li>
      <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to the Service or other users' data.</li>
      <li>Using the Service to transmit unlawful, harmful, or infringing content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-party services and links</h2>
    <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for their content or
      practices. Your use of third-party services is governed by their terms and policies.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>All rights, title and interest in and to the Service (excluding user-submitted content) are owned by us or our
      licensors. You are granted a limited, revocable, non-transferable license to use the app according to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee
      results from using the Service. Nothing in these Terms excludes our liability for death or personal injury
      resulting from negligence, or other liabilities that cannot be excluded under applicable law.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will we be liable for indirect, incidental, special,
      consequential or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the Service.</p>

    <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising out of your breach of these Terms or your
      violation of any law or rights of a third party.</p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time for violations of these Terms or other lawful
      reasons. Upon termination, your license to use the Service ends, but provisions that by their nature should
      survive (e.g., intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability) will survive.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to these Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify the Terms. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (for example, via app notification
      or email). Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
